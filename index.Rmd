Welcome to my website! I'm a second year psychology major with a minor in statistics. I enjoy [photography](https://brittsthoughts5361647.wordpress.com/2019/01/26/lunar-eclipse/#jp-carousel-100), creative writing, art, and learning new things.
I was born and raised in Canada and moved here my junior year of high school. It was a hard move but in the end I don't regret coming here because I was able to experience a lot of new things!
