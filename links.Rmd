Below you'll find the following links to a variety things including some of my photography, music I listen to when editing, and etc.

[Spring 2018](https://brittsthoughts5361647.wordpress.com/2019/01/26/spring-2018/)

[Fall 2018](https://brittsthoughts5361647.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/fall-2018/)

The two above links are to my blog that was created for another class I'm taking this semester. Both are shoots of my friends that I had for fun!

[Saturday Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esh8mNoPxGE)

[I'm so tired...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvjpE_wFL5A)

The two above songs are my current favorites and are on a playlist I listen to when I edit my work or even when I do any sort of homework in general.

[Peter McKinnon](http://www.petermckinnon.com/)

The above link named Peter McKinnon is a Canadian photographer and I really enjoy his work. I couldn't link his instagram and I think I'd be quite easy to just look up his Youtube channel but I get a lot of inspiration as well as he gives good tips and tricks in his videos.
